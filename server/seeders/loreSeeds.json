        "story": "As a mortal, Oshun was the beautiful third wife of the Emperor Shango of the Oyo kingdom. As an Orisha, she is the embodiment of love, femininity, beauty, and fertility. She is the spirit of sweet waters and the protective deity of the River Oshun in Nigeria. When the Supreme Creator Oludumare withheld rain from the world after the Orisha offended them, it was Oshun, the youngest of the Orisha, who transformed into a peacock and flew to heaven to commune with the Supreme Creator. By the time she arrived, her feathers had molted from the sun and she was no longer a beautiful peacock, but a vulture. Oludumare was moved by her sacrifice and persistence and agreed to return the rains to the earth, even making Oshun their emissary. To this day, those who wish to speak with Oludumare must go through Oshun to do so. She is the third and favorite wife of Shango and the mother of the ibeji, the sacred twins. Though she is known as one of the most powerful Orishas and is usually benevolent, Oshun still demonstrates human emotions like spite and envy. In a fit of jealousy, she convinced Shango’s first wife, Oba, to cut off her ear so that she would no longer rival Oshun’s beauty. However, even with these tendencies, she is often seen as a protector, nurture, and one who gives life.",
